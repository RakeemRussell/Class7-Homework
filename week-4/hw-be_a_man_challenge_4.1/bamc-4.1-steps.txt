Create a VPC (must have at least 3 availability zones)

Inside your VPC, build a single Windows bastion host within a public subnet, and one Linux web server per availability zone, all  in different private subnets

Each Linux web server should also display different text and pictures

Take screenshots of the running WIndows bastion host, the three Linux servers (highlighting the three different AZs in each photo), and a screenshot of a successful SSH connection to each Linux server from within the bastion host.
